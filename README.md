### TheKippurian

# *The plan for a sci-fi adventure.*

The Kippurian is a working title that formed, oh, well, I don't know, yesterday.
Now, every good thing has to start from somewhere - and when you're starting from scratch, that essentially means nowhere.

Let's not let that stop us. 

I'm approaching the public medium github presents for this project because I can share my ideas, publicly, and update them as I need. Down the line this aims to become a repository for resources that will be dedicated toward the project. And, as it is public, feel free to build off of all the resources compiled here - over time I hope to have a collection of materials that will really extend beyond this singular project.

# What is Kippur all about?

Kippur was the name of the planet on which this first story takes place on. (KPR-452b to be exact.) That is to say, Kippur is just something I came up with. The Kippurian is a lens to view that dream, one that I hope to carefully craft. I aim to create the equivalent of a universe, but, a carefully curated one. If the first game, novel, or story is the art, this shall be its art house; this shall stand as a gallery bearing all that this particular creation may have to bear. And like its denizens, The Kippurian hopes to be a constantly evolving piece of work.

# Why Github?

While any cooperation platform would work, starting out with github would streamline the process when it boils down to the programmatic end of the experience. Getting a game plan down of everything that is necessary is what must come first. That plan will act as a roadmap, and, while there might be bumps every few miles, I won't fall off that path to success - as long as I keep the map in sight of course!

I'm also hoping to crowdsource ideas from anyone who's willing to add to this project. *Anyone who wants to be a part of this world, can be.* And by using a medium like Github, anyone can freely add where they want to, how they want to, with credit where credit is due. Maybe not everything will be accepted into the revered 'canon' of the universe. But it doesn't have to. As the multiverse theory says, there are an infinite amount of possibilities and all of them true! Fork your own universes from this and branch out into the millions of alternate universes that may exist from this. Right now, very little exists in the way of accomplished storytelling. Give it time, and that too, shall change.

# How can you help?

A little help can go a long ways! Now, before you run off, what this consists of **is not** a call for any type of financial funding. This isn't a charity. As it stands, all this is, is a blueprint. But anything can be improved, and, seeing as this is public, asking for help isn't too out of the picture.

There are a few ways that you can directly influence the growth of this project, should you be so inclined and all of them are important. Each and every one is important in its own way.

**Content Production**

> In the path of submitting content, you can be responsible for adding to the canon, generating conceptual art, gameplay mechanics and general ideas that can be merged with existing information. Create your own branches or submit via alternative means as a way to help produce resources for the project itself! Plot points, side stories and lore are great ways to expand upon the universe and get your name snuggled in as one of the masterminds behind it all. The more people adding to the world, the larger the world will get.

**Content Revision**

> It's possible to help by revising the continuity of the universe, fixing glaring errors and making the necessary corrections. Ensuring paradoxes in the universe are resolved properly is only one path to take. Evaluating the continuity among other resources such as art and gameplay concepts, questioning their ability to add or weaken the integrity of the world building, is an important job that has to be done. The more people revising, the better the chance that nothing will fall through.

**Feedback**

> The most basic of help comes in the form of feedback. Respond to changes, suggest corrections and raise questions about what's being done to the world. "Does this really work here?" "Can it be less cliche?" The minds of those willing to ask the critical questions will help make the end result that much more fulfilling.

** Sharing is Caring **

> Share [thekippurian](https://thekippurian.wordpress.com/) where and when you can! And don't be afraid to star the github repository itself, to get it more views! Sharing is caring, so feel free to share [The Kippurian](https://github.com/rimij405/TheKippurian) repository. Become a contributor and raise awareness!

# This is all a waste of time! You'll never get anything done!

Time is just a waste, if it is spent meaninglessly daydreaming. Rather than daydream and do nothing with that wasted effort, I wish to add to this project in anyway I can. And I'll work as hard as I can for as long as possible until I'm satisfied with the end result. This isn't a summer project I am starting and tossing away - *it's an investment.* 

This is a life story and I can turn around and look back at it and say:
> Here's where it all began. This is how a universe was born.
